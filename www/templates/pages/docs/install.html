        Onyx is available to try online for free in <a href="/playground/">Onyx Playground</a>.
        It allows you learn the syntax from examples, without installing the language onto your system.

        <h3>From Source</h3>
        <p>
            The easiest way to install Onyx on a Linux system is to clone the repository from GitHub, and then compile from source.
            This is relatively simple, since Onyx does not use any fancy things in its source tree. Only C code and shell scripts.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Clone the respository at <a href="https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx">onyx-lang/onyx</a>.
                    <pre class="hljs"><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx --depth 1</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate into the new "onyx" directory.
                    <pre class="hljs"><code class="language-sh">cd onyx</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configure the <code>settings.sh</code> file to suit your system needs.
                    If everything looks good, (or if you don't know what you are looking at), you should be good to go.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run <code>./build.sh</code>.
                    This will compile and install Onyx onto your system.
                    By default, the "onyx" binary will be placed in "/usr/bin", and the necessary libraries/core packages/tooling will be installed at "/usr/share/onyx".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try running the "onyx help" command. You should see something like this.
                    <pre class="hljs"><code class="language-sh">$ onyx help

        run       Compiles and runs an Onyx program, all at once.
        check     Checks syntax and types of an Onyx program.
        watch     Continuously rebuilds an Onyx program on file changes.
        package   Package manager</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>
            In the future, Onyx may ship a ".deb" file for Debian-based distros to easily install.
            While this is planned, it is not a priority at the moment.

            <li>Add the extracted folder to your system or user's PATH variable.</li>
            <li>Make a new variable called "ONYX_PATH", and set it equal to the extracted folder path.</li>

        <li>Log out and log back in to let system environment variable update.</li>
        <li>Open a Command Prompt or Powershell instance, and try running "onyx help".</li>

<div class="container" id="macos">
    <h2>MacOS</h2>
    <p>
    MacOS support is not being actively worked on at the moment. In theory, if the compiler would work on MacOS, WebAssembly binaries would have no problem running using Wasmer, Wasmtime, or a similar runtime. Onyx is always open for contributions from others on its <a href="https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx/pulls">pull requests</a>.
