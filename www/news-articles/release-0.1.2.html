<h1>Beta Release 0.1.2</h1>

<p>
    This release of Onyx brings a substantial new feature called <em>tagged unions</em>, and a collection of other small bugfixes.
</p>

<h2>Tagged Unions</h2>
<p>
    Tagged unions are a big addition to the type system in Onyx, as they allow you to represent a new <em>kind</em> of type.
    They bring a number of safety and sanity features that Onyx had been lacking in its type system.
</p>

<p>
    At their core, tagged unions store at most one type of data at a time, and know which type they are currently holding.
    In order to use the data in the tagged union, you must do a <code>switch</code> statement, which guarantees that you can only access the data if it is of the correct type.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at a code example.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">
MultipleTypes :: union {
    int: i32;
    float: f32;
    string: str;
}   

main :: () {
    value := MultipleTypes.{ string="Tagged unions are cool!" };

    switch value {
        case .int do println("It was an integer!");
        case .float do println("It was a float!");
        case .string do println("It was a string!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This code will print <code>It was a string!</code>, because <code>value</code> currently holds the <code>string</code> variant.
    This is specified with <code>MultipleTypes.{ XXX = ... }</code>; <code>XXX</code> must be one of the variants of <code>MultipleTypes</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In order to access the data inside of the union, you can use a switch with a <em>capture</em>, like so.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">
main :: () {
    value := MultipleTypes.{ string="Tagged unions are cool!" };

    switch value {
        case .int => int_value do printf("It was an integer: {}\n", int_value);

        case .float => float_value do println("It was a float: {}\n", float_value);

        // You can also use it by pointer by placing a '&' before the variable.
        case .string => &str_value do println("It was a string: {}\n", *str_value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    You can also directly access the fields, like you would a structure.
    However, instead of getting the data directly, you get an <em>Optional</em> of the data.
    You then have to use the methods of the <em>Optional</em> type to access the data.
</p>


<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">MultipleTypes :: union {
    int: i32;
    float: f32;
    string: str;
}   

main :: () {
    v := MultipleTypes.{ float = 12.34 };
    
    // Using Optional.unwrap to get the data.
    // This will cause an exception if the union does not currently hold a 'float'.
    float_value := v.float->unwrap();
    println(float_value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Tagged unions can also be polymorphic, just like structures. With this feature, this is how the <code>Optional</code> type is now defined.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">Optional :: union (Value_Type: type_expr) {
    None: void;
    Some: Value_Type;
}

main :: () {
    v := Optional(i32).{ Some = 123 };

    switch v {
        case .None {
            println("No value :(");
        }

        case .Some => int_value {
            printf("Int value: {}\n", int_value);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>


<h2>Full Changelog</h2>
<pre>Additions:
* Tagged unions (<code>union</code> type)
* String literals can have unicode code points.
    - '\uXXXX' for small code points (less than U+FFFF)
    - '\UXXXXXX' for large code points
    - Does not support UTF-16 surrogate pairs
* <code>iter.next_opt</code>
* <code>memory.ptr_add</code>
* <code>misc.any_member</code>

Removals:

Changes:
* <Code>optional</code> is now a tagged-union
* <Code>result</code> is now a tagged-union
* <code>iter.single</code> can take a <code>dispose</code> function, which is called on close of the
    iterator, with the single value yielded.
* <code>io.write_escaped_str</code> supports escaping "\\" now.
* In Javascript runtime, made <code>__read_from_input</code> not defined right away, so
    it can be overridden depending on the needs of the program.

Bugfixes:
* <code>json</code> encoder was wrongly not encoding strings when using <code>encode</code> on an <code>any</code>.
