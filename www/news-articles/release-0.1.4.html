<h2>Map uses Optional</h2>

<p>
The <code>map.get</code> procedure is now defined like so:
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">Map.get :: (m: &Map($K, $V), k: K) -> ? V { ... }</code></pre>

<p>
This is more idiomatic as now the procedure can actually return "no result", without returning a dummy default value.
However, as <code>Map</code> is a core data structure used by many programs, this will break many programs.
This is why this release is smaller than most, as I want to get this change out there.
All libraries have been updated for this already.
</p>

<p>
To convert existing code, you will likely just need to add <code>?? .{}</code> after the <code>map.get</code> or <code>m[key]</code>.
This will provide a default value if <code>None</code> was returned.
</p>

<p>
A useful pattern I found myself using while converting the standard library was this:
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">
m: Map(str, str);
// ...
m->get("some key")->with([the_value] {
    // Do something with "the_value"
    println(the_value);
});
</code></pre>

<p>
The code inside of the <code>with</code> block is only executed if the value was present, so this acts like a <code>map.has</code> and <code>map.get</code> all at once.
</p>

<h2>Onyx package folder structure</h2>

<p>
In this version of Onyx, the package manager no longer outputs a flat directory structure for the included packages.
Instead, the <em>full path</em> to the package is used.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you include <code>https://github.com/someuser/somepackage</code>, then the path to that library will be <code>./lib/github.com/someuser/somepackage</code>.
This way, package names do not have to be unique across the Onyx ecosystem, as this is impossible to enforce as Onyx does not have a centralized package version manager.
</p>

<p>
This change should be transparent so long as you are using the <code>./lib/packages.onyx</code> file.
The next time you run <code>onyx package sync</code> this new folder structure will be created and switched to.
</p>

<h2>Full Changelog</h2>
<pre>
Release v0.1.4
-----------
22nd June 2023

Additions:

Removals:
- Deprecated `map.get_opt`.
    - This is unnecessary with the new semantics of `map.get`.

Changes:
- `onyx pkg` now stores synchronized packages in a different folder hierarchy.
    - This is a transparent change so long as you use the `lib/packages.onyx` file.
- `Map` implementation no longer holds a default value. Instead, it returns an optional from `map.get`.
    - This is a significant breaking change that will affect many programs.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug that made relative imports not always relative to the current file.
    - This may break some programs that were accidentally using this "feature".
- Fixed a bug with small a `union` over small data types, such as booleans.
    - There was an alignment issue, which caused the union to be smaller than expected.
