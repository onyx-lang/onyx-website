<h2>Syntax Additions and Changes</h2>

<h3>Closures</h3>
<p>
    Closures have existed in Onyx for several years, but the syntax was quite poor.
    Here is what they <em>used to</em> look like.
</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">main :: () {
    capture_me := "some string"

    f := (x, [capture_me]) => {
        printf("{}: {}", capture_me, x)
    }

    f(10) // "some string: 10"
}</code></pre>

<p>
    This syntax was partially inspired by C++, but moving the capture group inside the parentheses.
    I have never felt happy with this syntax, and using it always feels clunky to type and a pain to look at.
</p>

<p>
    The new syntax is not as "concise", but is much easier to read and is already used by other programming languages, most notably PHP.
    Simply place the <code>use</code> keyword after the close parentheses of the parameter list.
</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">main :: () {
    capture_me := "some string"

    f := (x) use (capture_me) => { // still need '=>' because this is a quick procedure
        printf("{}: {}", capture_me, x)
    }

    g := (x: i32) use (capture_me) -> void { // can omit '-> void'
        printf("{}: {}", capture_me, x)
    }

    f(10) // "some string: 10"
    g(10) // "some string: 10"
}</code></pre>

<p>
    Note, in the future, explicitly listing captured values <em>may not be necessary</em>.
</p>

<h3>Unwrap operator</h3>
<p>
    Onyx now has another post-fix unary operator called the <strong>unwrap operator</strong>, written <code>x!</code>.
    It is used by the <code>Optional</code> and <code>Result</code> types as an shorthand for <code>x->unwrap()</code>.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">main :: () {
    iterator := Iterator.from(1 .. 5)

    value := Iterator.next(iterator)! // Unwrap here
    printf("value: {}\n", value)      // Prints 'value: 1'

    iterator
        |> Iterator.map(x => x * 2)
        |> Iterator.next()! // You can "pipe" into unwrap, just like try (?)
        |> printf("another value: {}\n", _) // Prints 'another value: 4'
}</code></pre>

<p>
    It can be overloaded using <code>#operator!</code>.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">MyType :: struct { /* ... */ }

#operator! :: (mt: MyType) -> i32 {
    // ...
}</code></pre>

<h2>Custom commands</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Custom commands</strong> allow the Onyx CLI to be extended to include new tooling for Onyx development.
    These tools used to be only installable <em>globally</em>, and they were not indexed, so you had to know which
    tools you had installed.
</p>

<p>
    Now, these custom commands can be installed globally in the <code>ONYX_PATH/tools</code> directory, or per project
    in the <code>./.onyx</code> directory. These commands always come in the form of <code>.wasm</code> files that
    accept the remaining command-line arguments. In other words,
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-shell">$ onyx tool-name arg1 arg2
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-shell">$ onyx run resolved/path/to/tool-name.wasm -- arg1 arg2
</code></pre>

<p>
    Custom commands now show up in <code>onyx help</code>. They get their description by reading a custom section
    in the WASM binary called <code>onyx-command-description</code>. If you are creating a custom command and would
    like to set this, you can use the <code>#wasm_section</code> directive like so:
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">#wasm_section "onyx-command-description" "A concise description here."
</code></pre>

<h2>New Core APIs</h2>
<p>
    Onyx now has support for some common interchange formats and functionality used in web and server development.
</p>

<h3>Protobufs</h3>
<p>
    There is now an official <a href="https://github.com/onyx-lang/pkg-protobuf">protobuf</a> library for Onyx that supports serialization and deserialization.
    There is also a <a href="https://github.com/onyx-lang/protoc-gen-onyx">protoc plugin</a> that you can use to generate Onyx types from a <code>.proto</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Basic JWT support</h3>
<p>
    Onyx how has the beginnings of <code>core.crypto.keys</code>, with basic support for decoding and encoding HS256 JWTs.
    Once Onyx has support for other crypto functionality, namely RSA and EC, other token signatures can be implemented.
</p>

<h3>XML decoding</h3>
<p>
    Onyx now supports decoding XML documents in <code>core.encoding.xml</code>.
    Encoding XML should just be done with formatted printing to a <code>dyn_str</code>.
</p>

<h2>Other items of note</h2>

<h3>Changes to <code>#load</code> directive</h3>
<p>
    When loading more files into the current compilation, the <code>#load</code> directive behaved in an
    arguably strange way. It had a <em>global</em> search path, that you could append directories to using <code>#load_path</code>
    or <code>-I dir</code>. Unless you explicitly prefixed the file path with <code>./</code>, it would search
    through all known paths to find a match. When it did not find a match, it would default to loading the file
    from the current directory of the running "onyx" process.
</p>

<p>
    This behavior is quite non-standard amongst programming languages, and so it is revised in this release.
    Now, <em>all</em> <code>#load</code> directives are relative to the path of the current file, <em>unless</em>
    it is prefixed with a mapped folder name, followed by a colon, like so.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">#load "foo" // Will load `./foo.onyx`
#load "core:foo" // Will load `$ONYX_PATH/core/foo.onyx`
</code></pre>

<p>
    By default there is only one mapped directory, called <code>core</code>, that is set to <code>ONYX_PATH/core</code>.
    You can map your own directories using <code>--map-dir NAME:DIR</code> on the command line.
</p>

<p>
    Note, because of this change, the <code>-I</code> command-line argument has been removed, and the <code>#load_path</code>
    directive has been deprecated and no longer does anything. Mapped directories can only be set at the command-line.
</p>

<h3>Short-circuiting logic operators</h3>
<p>
    Onyx has had the standard boolean operators <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code>
    since its inception. But until this release, they did not behave how they do in
    <em>all other programming languages</em> &mdash; they did not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">short-curcuit</a>.
</p>
<p>
    That was fixed in this release. These operators now short-circuit as you would expect them to.
</p>

<h3>Fixed-sized arrays passed by value</h3>
<p>
    When trying to use fixed-sized arrays as "vector-like" types, there was
    a lot of unexpected behavior when passing them to functions. This was because
    fixed-sized arrays like <code>[4] i32</code> were passed by reference. In other
    words, a pointer to the first element was implicitly passed so any changes made to
    the array would be reflected in the original array.
</p>
<p> These semantics were copied from C and seemed logical for the time. But seeing how
    Onyx has evolved in a different direction, this no longer makes sense, so it has
    been changed &mdash; <strong>all fixed-sized arrays are now passed by value</strong>.
    If you still want the pass by reference semantics, use a slice type instead (<code>[] T</code>).
</p>

<h3>Referencing Git branches as dependencies</h3>
<p>
    When specifying dependencies in <code>onyx-pkg.kdl</code>, you can now target a particular
    branch from a repository, instead of a version. This will re-clone the branch ever time you
    run <code>onyx pkg sync</code>, which is useful when testing a package you are developing.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-kdl">dependencies {
    some-package branch="feature-branch" git="https://github.com/user/repo"
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Goals for 0.1.14</h2>
<p>
    My primary focus for 0.1.14 will be to refactor the entire codebase of the compiler to
    separate out the CLI from the compiler internals. The compiler internals will be available
    as a standard dynamic library and header file, so they can be embedded into interesting places.
    The CLI will then be rewritten to use these compiler internals.
</p>
<p>
    While in this process, I may extend the capabilities of compiler extensions with more hooks and
    program introspection. But, I have not yet designed what that system will look like, so that may
    be on hold until 0.1.15 or later.
</p>

<h2>Updating</h2>
<p>
    To update to the newest version of Onyx simply use the same install script found on the homepage.
    It will automatically detect your previous install and will override it with the new version.
</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-sh">$ sh <(curl https://get.onyxlang.io -sSfL)
</code></pre>
<p>
    You can also run <code>onyx self-upgrade</code> if you are on MacOS or Linux!
</p>
<p>
    Happy programming!
</p>
