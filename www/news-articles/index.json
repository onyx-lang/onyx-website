I have been working on other projects (using Onyx!) and have not had the time needed to dedicate to new features in the language. That being said, Onyx already has many of the features that I need for my projects, so I have not felt the need to add new features. However, I have been fixing bugs and blatant wrong implementations of core library procedures that have been getting in my way. Enough of these have accumulated over the past couple of months that I believe it is worth it to publish them in a new bugfix release."
