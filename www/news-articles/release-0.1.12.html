<h2>Pipe improvements</h2>

<p>
    The pipe operator (<code>|></code>) saw a number of semantic improvements in this release.
</p>

<p>
    You can now pipe into a method call.
    This has the semantics you would expect: the implicit argument from the method call becomes the first argument, and the piped argument becomes the second argument.
    In other words, <br><code>x |> y->z() === y.z(&y, x)</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Here is one example where this could be useful.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">main :: () {
    my_arr := make([..] i32)

    iter.counter()
    |> iter.take(10)
    |> iter.map(x => x * 2)
    |> my_arr->concat()     // Piping directly into this method call

    println(my_arr)
}</code></pre>


<p>
    You can also now pipe into a try operator (<code>?</code>).
    This also has the semantics you would expect: the try operator is left on the outside of the call and the piped argument is placed normally in the call.
    In other words, <br><code>x |> y()? === y(x)?</code>.
</p>

<p>
    This feature enables an interesting pattern of computation that allows for chaining of fallible operations, letting you focus on the "happy path" of your code.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">do_something :: x => {
    return x
        |> fallible_operation_1()?
        |> fallible_operation_2()?
        |> fallible_operation_3()
}</code></pre>


<h2>Phasing out of <code>#auto</code></h2>

<p>
    In the on-going effort to simply Onyx, the <code>#auto</code> directive is being phased out in favor of <code>_</code>.
</p>

<p>
    As a reminder, <code>#auto</code> was used when you don't want to spell out the type explicitly, but have the type solved by the compiler.
    This was allowed in two places: as a return type, and as a local variable type.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">// Old way
foo :: () -> #auto {
    x: #auto
    x = "test"
    return x
}</code></pre>

<p>
    Now, the (arguably) ugly <code>#auto</code> directive is no longer necessary.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">// New way
foo :: () -> _ {
    x: _
    x = "test"
    return x
}</code></pre>

<p>
    Like many other things, <code>#auto</code> still works in 0.1.12, but will be removed in a future version.
</p>

<h2>Simplified <code>onyx.js</code></h2>

<p>
    The JavaScript file generated as a part of compiling with <code>-r js</code> is no longer an ES6 module.
    While ES6 modules are generally the standard nowadays, there are still some cases where having an ES6 is a problem.
    To make Onyx easier to use in a variety of JS environment, ES6 modules were ditched in this release.
    You should be able to load the JS file in a normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag on the browser, or using <code>require</code> in something like Node JS.
</p>

<p>
    This is now what you need to run Onyx in a browser, for example.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="/out.wasm.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    Onyx.load("/out.wasm").then(program => program.start())
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>


<h2>WebAssmebly <code>name</code> section</h2>

<p>
    When looking at a WebAssembly module, whether it be through a inspection tool like <code>wasm-tools</code> or <code>wasm-objdump</code>, or in the Developer Tools of your favorite browser, having names on functions can be very useful.
    While there is not a great standard for debug information in WebAssembly as of today (though work is being done by the community), at least having function names can help you figure out from a stack trace where your program is currently executing.
</p>

<p>
    Onyx now supports emitting the special <code>name</code> table that is understood by all WebAssembly tooling.
    Currently, only function names are generated, as they are the most useful, but local names may be added in the future.
    To actually generate the <code>name</code> table, you need to pass the <code>--generate-name-section</code> flag to <code>onyx build</code>.
    This is not done by default, as it does inflate the binary size.
</p>
