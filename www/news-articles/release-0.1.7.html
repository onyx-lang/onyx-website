<h1>Beta Release 0.1.7</h1>
<p>
    This release of Onyx brings exciting and overdue features, including switch expression, WASIX support and an overhauled networking layer.
</p>

<h2>Switch Expressions</h2>
<p>
    Switch expressions allow you to write inline <code>switch</code> statements that evaluate to values, removing
    a common pattern that can be seen here:
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">x: u32;
switch value {
    case .Case1 do x = 2;
    case .Case2 do x = 3;
    case .Case3 do x = 5;
    case .Case4 do x = 7;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The above code can be rewritten like so:
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">// When `switch` appears in an expression, its cases must look like
//    case X => value
//
x: u32 = switch value {
    case .Case1 => 2;
    case .Case2 => 3;
    case .Case3 => 5;
    case .Case4 => 7;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    One caveat to this new feature is that it stole the syntax for capturing a value when switching over a tagged
    union. To fix this, <code>case</code> blocks that capture the union value were given a new syntax that looks like <code>for</code>-loops.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">x: ? i32 = .{ Some = 123 };

switch x {
    // By value
    case value: .Some {
        printf("X has value {}\n", value);
    }

    // Or by pointer
    case &value: .Some {
        printf("X has value {}\n", *value);
    }
}
</code></pre>


<h2>Networking Overhaul</h2>
<p>
A majority of the work done in this release was refactoring the networking portion of the core libraries to
operate at the <em>platform</em> layer. The platform layer is an abstraction layer that sits just above all
of the interesting system level operations, like file-operations, threads, and now networking.
</p>

<p>
Before, all network code was not abstracted because the <code>onyx</code> runtime was the only one that could
support networking, so it wasn't a high priority item to refactor. That has changed however, with Wasmer's
introduction of <em>WASIX</em>.
</p>

<h2>WASIX</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://wasix.org">WASIX</a> is an extention of WASI, with inspiration from POSIX functions. It brings many useful things like networking,
TTY, futexes, better threads, and even <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>.
</p>

<p>
This version of Onyx enables networking, TTY control, and futexes when compiling to the <code>wasi</code> runtime when <code>runtime.vars.WASIX</code>
is defined. You can easily do this by passing <code>-DWASIX</code> on the command line or by adding this line of code to your file.
</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">use runtime
#inject runtime.vars.WASIX :: true
</code></pre>

<h2>DynCallback Integration</h2>
<p>
A long awaited feature when it comes to working with C libraries is the ability to pass an Onyx function to a C library as a callback.
This is a common pattern employed by many C libraries, so it would be very nice to support it. Thanks to <code><a href="https://dyncall.org">dyncallback</a></code>,
this is possible and very easy.
</p>

<p>
The <code>cbindgen</code> library now supports translating functions passed as arguments into the C bindings that wrap an Onyx function
in a native function using <code>dyncallback</code>.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">#foreign "libraryA" {
    external_func :: (callback: (i32) -> void) -> void ---
}

main :: () {
    external_func(x => {
        println(x);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that while it should be possible to use this with other WebAssembly runtimes, Wasmer does not currently provide a couple of
crucial functions in their C api to make this work. So sadly, you must be using the <code>ovmwasm</code> runtime to use this feature.
</p>

<h2>Full Changelog</h2>
<pre>
Additions:
- Support for WASIX, a new, extended standard to WASI, popularized by Wasmer.
    - Define `WASIX` in `runtime.vars` to enable it. (`-DWASIX` on the CLI)
    - Adds support for networking, futexes, and TTY control in WASI.
- `switch` expressions.
    - `switch` can appear at the expression level, and uses `case X => value` to
      specify cases.
- `cbindgen` now supports passing functions as arguments.
    - Internally uses dyncallback
    - Only for OVM-wasm and Linux, for now.
- Scoped values in interfaces. `X :: ...` is allowed in an interface now.
- `#inject` works on interfaces.
- Polling to the `io.Stream` functionality.
    - Used to query when data is read/write-able from a stream, for supported streams.
    - `io.stream_poll`
- `misc.any_unwrap` to unwrap an `any` containing an optional.
- `json.decode_with_result`
- `json.decode_into`
- `slice.group_by`

Removals:

Changes:
- Complete overhaul of networking in the core library.
    - Backwards compatiblity was not strictly maintained, but common functions did
      not change, like `socket_send` and `socket_recv`.
- When debugging, `/ 0` or `% 0` will trigger an exception to debug the error.

Bugfixes:
- `alloc.atomic` package was broken when `sync` package was missing.
- `X.foo` would not work if `X` was a pointer to a union.
- Captures by pointer would break if the value was a primitive whose address wasn't
  taken anywhere else.
- Symbol name reported by documentation generation was incorrect for some methods.
