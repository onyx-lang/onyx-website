<h1>Onyx's Memory Model</h1>

<p>
When choosing and/or learning a programming language, the memory model is one of the first things you will have to understand to successfully use the language.
In broad terms, there are three memory models employed in programming languages used today: <i>manual, manual with assistance, and automatic.</i>
</p>

<p>
In a <i>manual</i> memory model, almost all memory allocations and deallocations are done, well, manually.
You, the programmer, are responsible for diligently freeing <i>every</i> piece of memory you allocate; otherwise, over time, your program's memory usage will increase and start consuming a lot of system resources.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Do note, that this only applies to programs that run for a long time, or need to work with a lot of resources.
    Forgetting to free a 100 element array in your small 10 line program is not going to be the end of the world.
    The operating system is responsible for reclaiming all resources your program used when your program exits.
</blockquote>

<p>
In an <i>automatic</i> memory model, you are not responsible for managing any allocation made by your program.
Programming languages with this memory model generally employ a garbage collector or reference counted pointers.
</p>

<p>
The third and final memory model is <i>manual with assistance</i>, which is the memory model that Onyx uses.
This model trusts the programmer to understand their memory needs, allowing total control over memory.
However, it also offers core library support for describing the memory model.
</p>

<h2>Allocators</h2>

<p>
Onyx abstracts the notion of memory management into an <i>Allocator</i>.
Anything that requires allocating memory should consume an Allocator as a parameter.
This is the pattern followed by everything in the core library; all memory allocations are configurable.
Also as a convience, the default allocator used by the core library is <code>context.allocator</code>.
This is a thread-local variable that is a general purpose heap allocator by default, but can be changed.
This allows for changing the allocator used by a library even if the library does not take an allocator as a paramter.
</p>

<p>
Most programmers will not have to write their own allocator.
Instead they will use one of half-dozen provided out of the box by the core libraries.
</p>

<h3>Heap Allocator</h3>
<p>
In every Onyx program, there is a single general purpose heap allocator.
It can be accessed in <code>core.alloc.heap_allocator</code>.
It is automatically setup before your program reaches <code>main</code>.
It is also the default allocator used by <code>context.allocator</code>, meaning functions like <code>new</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>calloc</code> will use it by default.
</p>

<blockquote>
While Onyx has its own heap allocation procedures, the heap allocator is effectively equivalent to C's <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.
You are responsible for manually freeing the memory allocated from it.
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is an example of using the heap allocator directly.
</p>

<pre class="hljs"><code class="language-onyx">use core {*}

main :: () {
    // Directly allocate an array of 10 u32's.
    data := cast([&] u32) alloc.heap_allocator->alloc(sizeof u32 * 10);

    // Ensure the memory is freed when the function returns.
    defer alloc.heap_allocator->free(data);

    // Fill the array with squares
    for 10 {
        data[it] = it * it;
    }

    // Print out the array
    for 10 {
        println(data[it]);
    }
}
</code></pre>


<h3>Arena Allocator</h3>

<p>
While the general purpose heap allocator will work in any situation, it is not the fastest.
Also, it requires you to correctly manage the memory allocated from it, which can be error prone.
