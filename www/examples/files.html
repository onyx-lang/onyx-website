<div class='description'>This example shows various ways of reading and writing to a file. The core idea behind files in Onyx is that they extend the <code>io.Stream</code> structure, so you can use the <code>core.io</code> package to interact with them.</div>

    // This is one way of opening a file: call os.open and then os.close later.

    // to use the os.File. This program opts to unwrap the result.

    // Create an io.Writer over the file stream using io.writer_make.

    // the internal buffer of io.Writer to make sure everything is written
    // to the file.
