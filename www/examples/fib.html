//
// Way number 1: A simple for-loop
// This method simply uses a for-loop like you would in C to generate
// the Fibonacci numbers. No tricks to it.
//
fib_for_loop :: (n: i32) -> u64 {
    a: u64 = 0
    b: u64 = 1

    for 0 .. n {
        tmp := a
        a = b
        b = tmp + b
    }

    return a
}

//
// Way number 2: Functional folding
// This way creates an iterator that will yield n integers, thats the
// iter.counter piped to iter.take(n). Then, for each one of those numbers
// it steps the state, computing the Fibonacci numbers in the process.
// The final result is the "a" member of the final state.

FibState :: struct { a, b: u64 }

fib_by_fold :: (n: i32) => {
    end_state := 
        // This creates an infinite iterator that simply counts up from 0.
        iter.counter()

        // This limits only taking the first n values.
        |> iter.take(n)

        // This performs a "fold" or "reduce" operation.
        |> iter.fold(
            // This defines the initial accumulator state.
            FibState.{ a = 0, b = 1 },

            // This defines the "folding" function. It takes the next value
            // from the iterator, which we simply ignore because we do not
            // need it, and the previous value of the accumulator. It then
            // computes and returns the next value for the accumulator.
            // iter.fold returns the final value of the accumulator.

//
// Way number 3: A custom iterator
// This way produces an iterator that yields consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
// This is slightly faster than the previous methods because it does not have
// to redo all the work for every query.
//

fib_iterator :: (n: i32) => 
    // This is implemented using a generator, which is a custom iterator
    // that yields values according to the "next" function defined below.

        // The initial state of the generator.
        &.{ a = cast(u64) 0, b = cast(u64) 1, counter = n },

        // The generation function. This takes in a pointer to the state
        // and must return an optional of the iteration type. If it is Some(u64)
        // then the iteration continues. If it is None, then the iterations stop.
        // 
        // Notice that the parameter's type is a polymorphic here notice the $.
        // This is because the above structure literal is entirely type infered
        // no explicit type was given to it. Therefore, there is no type we can
        // write here that would be correct. We could make a structure for it,
        // but in this case it is fine to let the compiler do a little magic.
        (state: & $Ctx) -> ? u64 {
            if state.counter <= 0 {
                return .None
            }

            tmp := state.a
            state.a = state.b
            state.b = state.b + tmp

            state.counter -= 1
